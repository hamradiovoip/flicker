 Flicker is an open-source stand-alone computer program for visually comparing 2D gel images. Two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) gels are often difficult to compare because of rubber-sheet distortions. Flicker allows you to visually compare your gel images against each other or against those found in Internet databases. Many published Internet gels have a subset of spots identified which may make them useful to compare with your gels. Some of these Internet gels are active maps that you can click on a spot to inquire of its identity. You may be able to draw putative conclusions as to the identification of some spots in your gels that visually appear to be the same spots as in reference gels. The Flicker program integrates these various needs to help you try to make putative spot identifications. 
 
 The Flicker application is Java program that runs under the MS Windows, MacOS-X, Linux and Solaris operating systems. It is downloaded to and runs on your computer. Flicker has been made open source and was contributed to the Open2Dprot project. Both the executable binary as well as the source code is available.
