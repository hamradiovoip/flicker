Flicker Revision History
</H2>
<P>

This describes the revision history. Generally, only the most recent
versions are kept on the Web site (see <A
HREF="FlickerJarVersion.txt">Version</A>).

<UL>


<P><LI><B>V.0.87.2 04-12-2007</B>: Corrected documentation. 
Validated that SWISS-2DPAGE clickable image maps still work. 
Memory change by editin the LAX file from the Edit Menu since
the use of InstallAnywhere installers was previously depricated. 

<P><LI><B>V.0.87.1.1 12-23-2005</B>: Fixed compilation error. 

<P><LI><B>V.0.87.1 11-07-2005</B>: Changed installer paradigm to use
<A HREF="http://launch4j.sf.net/">launch4j</A>. Also, new manifest for
Flicker.jar file that now includes the Class-Path so the demo .bat
and .sh scripts were simplified in this release. The (<B>Edit menu |
Resize memory limits</B>) command was depricated - see 
<A HREF="flkRefMan.html#increasingMemory">Increasing or decreasing the 
allowable memory used by Flicker</A> in the Reference manual.

<P><LI><B>V0.86.2 08-01-2005:</B> Fixed an intermittant bug such that
if you were flickering the zoomed lower right part of the image with
the guard region enabled, it would not always show the correct
alignment.


<P><LI><B>V0.86.1 07-28-2005:</B> Added guard region around perimeter
of the images. This allows spots that are any edge of the image to be
aligned in the flicker window. The right and left images can still be
zoomed, transformed and have their contrast and brightness changed
while the guard region is on.  The color of the guard region can be
changed via the edit-set colors menu. The default is to not use the
guard region. There is an intermittant bug such that if you are
flickering the zoomed lower right part of the image with the guard
region enabled, it may not always show the correct alignment. The
solution until we fix this is to avoid using zoom with the guard when
flickering.

<P><LI><B>V0.85.7 07-20-2005:</B> Fixed bug in (File | Open recent 
images) menu command. This involved changes in FlkRecent.java Bugs
that included fixing bug that allowed array index to be out of 
bounds in "open recent images" causing it to crash. String compare was
not correct, deleteOldestEntry() was not being called in the correct
place and a "for" loop in deleteOldestEntry() was incrementing the
upper value so it would go into a endless loop. Also fixed bug in 
ImageScroller.java where it caused "drawImage" in paint twice
in ImageScroller. This bug might have caused some additional image 
instability while flickering.

<P><LI><B>V0.85.6 06-15-2005:</B> Fixed thread-race condition which
occasionally locked up Flicker.

<P><LI><B>V0.85.4 06-14-2005:</B> Improved layout so canvases use more
of the "real estate" of the main window. Added tool-tips for the
buttons. We will be adding tool-tips for other GUI controls.

<P><LI><B>V0.85.3 06-08-2005:</B> Fixed bug introduced in V0.84.2 which
broke the Zoom. Fixed a few other minor bugs.

<P><LI><B>V0.84.2 05-27-2005:</B> Changed the implementation of parts
of the GUI to use Swing objects (frames, scrollers, buttons and
panels). Cleaned up some problems related to images not repainting
correctly when invoking the flicker mode under some conditions. Fixed
the "add" and "delete" Landmarks that was broken in the previous
release. Reduced delay for initial image loading.

<P><LI><B>V0.84.1 04-28-2005:</B> Fixed bugs related to incomplete
restoration of the Flicker state when restarting from a .flk file.
The old behavior was that the flicker window did not changed when you
changed the cursor in either the right or left lower
windows. Remaining bugs related to this that we are working on
include: the flicker window is not quite square, the position of the
flicker window is not restored. These will be fixed in the next
release.

<P><LI><B>V0.83.6 09-12-2004:</B> Added optional Web access to PIR <A
HREF="http://www.uniprot.org/">UniProt</A>, <A
HREF="http://pir.georgetown.edu/iproclass">iProClass</A> and <A
HREF="http://pir.georgetown.edu/iprolink">iProLink</A> Web pages
through their Swiss-Prot accession names. This is accomplished in a
2-step process. This is enabled in the (<B>Edit | Select access to
active DB server | <IMG SRC="Icons/checkboxON.gif" ALT="Checkbox on"> ...</B>) checkbox
command to select either Swiss-2DPAGE, UniProt, iProClass or iProLink
servers. If you measure a spot (select a spot in an active image and
then type <B>C-M</B>) (and are connected to the Internet), it will
lookup the Swiss-Prot protein (accession name, and protein id) on the
Swiss-2DPAGE server. Then, if you enable "Click to access DB", it will
pop up the particular active DB server you have selected. An
additional option is to enable the (<B>Edit | <IMG
SRC="Icons/checkboxON.gif" ALT="Checkbox on">Auto measure, protein lookup and Web page
popup</B>) checkbox command. Then when you click on a spot in an
active image (associated with a Web database), it will: 1. measure the
spot and add it to the spot list; 2. lookup the Swiss-Prot (name, id);
and 3. pop up the Web server on the currently selected active DB
server.

<P><LI><B>V0.83.5 08-25-2004:</B> Fixed but where active image name
status was not being set properly. Improved documentation in Reference
Manual <A HREF="flkRefMan.html#SpotListIDlookup">section 1.4.1</A> and
added a <A HREF="Vignettes/flkVig-putativeID-Assign.html">Vignette on
assigning putative spot ids</A>.

<P><LI><B>V0.83.4 07-21-2004:</B> If you saved the Flicker state in a
.flk file having zoomed one or both images, it does now rezooms the
image(s) when you restart Flicker on that startup file.

<P><LI><B>V.0.83.3 7-03-2004:</B> Fixed remaining problems with zoom
overlays (see 0.83.1).

<P><LI><B>V.0.83.2 6-21-2004:</B> Fixed another MacOS-X path bug on
startup, and added Quickstart and other Help menu entries.

<P><LI><B>V.0.83.1 6-17-2004:</B> Fixed problem with truncation of
zoom function by complete rewrite of Zoom methods and ImageScroller.
There may still be a few problems with overlays when zoomed greater or
less than 1.0X. These problems may sometimes include: landmarks,
measurement in lower quadrant, ROI in lower quadrant, edit measurement
spots.

<P><LI><B>V.0.82.4 6-10-2004:</B> Fixed MacOS-X path bug on startup.
and added additional Help menu entries.

<P><LI><B>V.0.82.4 5-25-2004:</B> Changed Help menu documentation
link.

<P><LI><B>V.0.82.1 5-01-2004:</B> Fixed non-fatal bug that occured
sometimes when restarting Flicker by clicking on a .flk file. It
would incorrectly report that you had run out of memory. However,
it was incorrect since clicking OK would let Flicker startup
with the correct data.

<P><LI><B>V.0.81.5 4-21-2004:</B> Also fixed problems with image zoom
and dezoom.

<P><LI><B>V.0.81.4 4-21-2004:</B> Fixed bug in naming of calibration
files so it now generates for the demo images, "cal/{demo-images}.cal"
file names; and for sub image directories in
Images/{sub-dirs}/(images} it generates "cal/{sub-dirs}-DIR-{images}.cal"
files. 

<P><LI><B>V.0.81.3 3-24-2004:</B> Final fix for bug where Flicker
would crash on startup if you started it with an empty user directory
in the Images/ directory. We thought this was fixed on V0.81.2 but it
wasn't :-) [Thanks to Neil Kitteringham for helping find this bug.]

<P><LI><B>V.0.81.2 3-23-2004:</B> Fixed bug where Flicker would crash
on starting if you had too many subdirectories of images in the user's
Images/ directory.

<P><LI><B>V.0.81 3-19-2004:</B> Misc bug fixes. The color TIFF image
reader is now working for un-banded TIFF images (including
uncompressed, JPEG compressed and packed bits - but not for LempleZev
compression because Sun's JAI TIFF reader avoids the copyright
issue). It does not work with banded images at this time. If you want
to read a banded or LempleZev compressed image, then convert it using
a program such as ThumbsPlus or other image manipulation program.


<P><LI><B>V.0.80 3-18-2004:</B> Added command (see <A
HREF="flkRefMan.html#addingUserDemos">discussion Section 4.6.2</A>) to
allow groups to setup a Flicker compatible database and then import
the data into the Flicker "open demo images" menu. The new (<B>File |
Updates | Add user's Flicker Demo Images DB by URL</B>) command adds
additional demo database from a another Web server to the local
Flicker demo database [suggested by Mark Holme]. Also fixed problem
where images were sometimes clipped if you read a larger image than
the default image or there was a incorrect region at the bottom of the
new image if it were smaller than the previous image.

<P><LI><B>V.0.79 3-17-2004:</B> We reorganized and simplified some of
the View menu commands. First, we moved and renamed the (<B>View | Set
view overlay | View measurements | ...</B>) menu tree to (<B>View |
Set view measurement options | ...</B>). Second, for consistency, the
(<B>View | Set view overlay | ...</B>) command was renamed (<B>View |
Set view overlay options | ...</B>).

"><P><LI><B>V.0.78 3-16-2004:</B> Changed state scrollers (upper right)
so that they are inoperable unless you select (click on the left or
right image) and it alerts you to this. Also disabled menu commands
that require you to select the right or left image until you do
so. Added default save files for the "Save overlay image" and "Save
transformed image". Cleaned up the design so it is now easier and more
consistent to switch between list-of-spots measurement mode and
trial-measurement mode using the new (<B>Quantify | List-of-spots else
trial-spot measurement-mode (C-J)</B>) command. Removed the old
commands which were equivalent but were confusing (<B>Quantify | Set
view overlay | View measurements | View list-of-spots else trial-spot
measurement-mode (C-J)</B>) and (<B>Quantify | Measurement
counters</B>). The visualization of zoomed (dezoomed) spots, ROI,
landmarks are now generated correctly. Note: you must currently define
these objects in 1.0X unzoomed mode.

<P><LI><B>V.0.77 3-15-2004:</B> Fixed bug when clearing spot list(s)
on data from spot list(s) loaded with a .flk file. It was not deleting
the spot list and reseting the spot counter.

<P><LI><B>V.0.76 3-14-2004:</B> Changed the way the circle mask size
may be defined. We now only allow it to be set from the scroller "meas
circle: XXX (diameter)" - the checkboxes previously used are no longer
available. The maximum size is now 51x51 which should make it easier
to measure larger spots. If you attempt to delete a spot using the
(<B>C-K</B>) command, it will ask you if you are sure since there is
no "undo" command. <BR>

<B>1. NOTE: we changed the old (C-I) short-cut command to
(C-K)</B>. The (<B>C-I</B>) is <I>NOW</I> used to bring up a short
edit form to define or change the spot annotation 'id' fields for the
measured spot(s) selected in the image(s). The same id value you enter
is assigned to both spots if you are editing two spots (selected from
the left and right images). The full command is (<B>Quantify | Measure
by circle | Edit selected spot(s) 'id' fields from spot list(s)
(C-I)</B>).  We fixed some bugs where the circle size shown was
different between the circles in a list of measured spots and in the
non-list spot measurement. The data was the same. <BR>

<B>2. NOTE</B>: we find it useful to adjust the circle size around a
spot, by temporarily turning off the (<B>View | Set view overlays |
View measurements | <IMG SRC="Icons/checkboxOFF.gif" ALT="Checkbox off">View
list-of-spots else trial-spot measurement mode (C-J)</B>) while
leaving the (C<B>View | Set view overlays | View measurements | <IMG
SRC="Icons/checkboxON.gif" ALT="Checkbox on">View measurement circle</B>) on. Then click
on a spot and type (<B>C-M</B>) to get a trial spot measurement.  As
you adjust the "meas circle" size diameter scroller, it will redraw
the circle around the spot as well as display the new integrated
density in the image title (if (<B>C-G</B>) was enabled. <BR>

<B>3. NOTE</B>: the (<B>View | Set view overlays | View measurements |
<IMG SRC="Icons/checkboxON.gif" ALT="Checkbox on">View list of spot measurements</B>)
has been moved to the Quantify menu and renamed (<B>Quantify | <IMG
SRC="Icons/checkboxON.gif" ALT="Checkbox on">View list-of-spots else trial-spot
measurement mode (C-J)</B>) and given a (<B>C-J</B>) short-cut key to
make toggling between modes easier.  Fixed problem of trying to save
an unsaved spot list on exit if you had never defined the .flk startup
file (it now prompts you for a .flk file name). Fixed the problem
where the scroller states for the images was not setup in the correct
order and was being overloaded with the default state.


<P><LI><B>V.0.75 3-10-2004:</B> Fixed fixed several bugs: 1) problem
where loading spot lists takes a long time when restarting from .flk
file, 2) sorted spot list data for calibrate OD by spot list, various
error msgs, added un-norm paired spot list table command (in addition
to norm paired spot list table), 3) synchronized circle mask size menu
items with scrollable circle mask size slider.

<P><LI><B>V.0.74 3-9-2004:</B> Fixed bug where it prompted whether you
wanted to clear the spot list if you started Flicker by clicking on a
.flk file which had spot lists. Changed the Alert window color to a
less obtrusive pink-gray instead of red. Added (<B>Quantify | Measure
by Circle | List paired 'id' annotated-spots in both spot lists
(tab-delimited))</B> - list paired spots that occur in the spot lists
of both gels. The pairing is defined by assigning the same annotation
spot 'id' using the (<B>C-I</B>) spot editing command to assign the
case-sensitive spot identifiers. (<B>C-E</B>) command may also be used
to edit the ids'.

<P><LI><B>V.0.73 3-8-2004:</B> Additional cleanup and fixed bug where
screen size grew when longerer messages were introduced.  Alpha-level
implemention of TIFF images (24-bit RGB).

<P><LI><B>V.0.72 3-5-2004:</B> This version is the alpha-level release
for the the new calibration by measured spot list. This uses the
(<B>Quantify | Calibrate | Optical density by spot list</B>). Also
added an alternative way to measure spots - in addition to using the
(<B>C-M</B>) <I>after</I> you have selected the spot using the mouse,
you can alternatively hold the <B>ALT-key</B> when you press the mouse
to select and measure the spot. This is easier to use when measuring
many spots. It combines spot selection and measurement in one
operation. [Thanks to Enrico DeToni and Greg Thornwall]

<P><LI><B>V.0.71 3-4-2004:</B> Changed the file name convention for
calibration files. Previous to this version, the "cal/{imageFile}.cal"
files were not unique if the same file name appeared in multiple user
image file directories using the "Images/{user directories}/{image
files}". This problem has been fixed by prepending the directory name
with a "-DIR-" separator before the cal file so the new .cal file name
is "cal/{user image subdirectory}-DIR-{image file}.cal".

<P><LI><B>V.0.70 3-3-2004:</B> Fixed bug with false popup alert if did
not find Flicker.properties file the first time it was run. Also fixed
some of the bugs with the new spot list calibration (not enabled
yet). Working on new .cal file naming fct so the .cal files will be
unique.

<P><LI><B>V.0.69 3-1-2004:</B> Fixed calibration ND wedge wizard problems
with aborting a calibration by answering NO on close. Fixed OD values
inherited from paired gel that was previously calibrated. This saves
having to type it in again.

<P><LI><B>V.0.68 2-26-2004:</B> Fixed "Optical-density" radix format
for the (<B>Quantify menu | Print data-window | Show data-window of
selected pixel (C-V)</B>) command.  Fixed format for precision of
floating point data to exactly the number of digits in the fraction
required. Added new command (<B>File | Open user images | ...</B>) so
split it into two menu trees. The first, (<B>File | Open user images |
pairs of images | ...</B>) is the same as the previous functionality.
The second, (<B>File | Open user images | single images | ...</B>)
lets you load any single image from any of the user's image
directories into either the selected left or right image. Fixed peak
table update and display problem in ND wedge calibration plot and
table.

<P><LI><B>V.0.67 2-22-2004:</B> Fixed bug in (<B>Quantify | Calibrate
| Optical density by step wedge</B>) command. Added (<B>Quantify |
Calibrate| Clear spot list (ask first)</B>) command. Updated the
Reference manual with examples on spot list overlay views and the
(<B>Quantify | Calibrate | Optical density by step wedge</B>) command.
Fixed bug to cancel save .flk file on exit if you were prompted with
Yes/No/Cancel on saving the edited spot list(s).

<P><LI><B>V.0.66 2-21-2004:</B> Fixed various minor bugs. Changed the
spot list display paradigm so that the user has more control over the
spot labeling that is useful for crowed regions. You can do this via
the (<B>View | Set view overlays | Set view measurements
(submenu)</B>).  These let you customize the displays.  The submenu
commands include:
<UL>
<LI> <B>View measurement circle</B> for (C-B and (C-M) trial spots
<LI> <B>View list of spot measurement</B> for viewing spot lists<P>

<LI> <B>Use 'Circle' for spot locations</B> OR
<LI> <B>Use '+ for spot locations</B> OR neither.<P>

<LI> <B>Use 'spot number' for spot annotations</B> AND/OR
<LI> <B>Use 'spot identifier for spot annotations</B> OR neither.
</UL>
You can select the "current" measured spot (click the mouse on it) and
the spot labels and annotation will change to the trial object color
while you have selected it. Two new commands were added to make it
easier to edit and delete spots in the spot list. We added a string
"spot identifier". You can set this identifier by selecting the spot
and then using the (<B>Quantify | Measure by circle | Edit selected
spot from spot list (C-E)</B>) command. Similarly you can delete any
spot by selecting it and then using the (<B>Quantify | Measure by
circle | Delete selected spot from spot list (C-I)</B>)
command. [Thanks to suggestions by Enrico De Toni].<P>

We added a new scroller "measure circle size" to the parameter
scrollers.  This is equivalent to going into the (<B>Quantify |
Measure by circle | Circular mask size (pixels) | ...</B>) and
selecting a size. However it is more convenient and gives you better
visual feedback.[Thanks to suggestions by Enrico De Toni].<P>

<B>Calibration of grayscale in other units (e.g., optical density)</B><BR>
We have activated the grayscale calibration using an neutral density
(or other known standard) step-wedge scanned with the material (e.g.,
2D-gel) when it was scanned. You must know the calibration values
(e.g., OD or CPM, etc.) corresponding to the step wedge. You set the
computing window Region Of Interest (ROI) over the step wedge and then
use the (<B>Quantify | Calibrate | Optical density by step wedge</B>)
command. To demonstrate this process, we have built in four sample
ROI's and the corresponding OD values corresponding to the step wedge
scanned with the four demo gels (Leukemia-AML, Leukemia-ALL,
Leukemia-CLL, Leukemia-HCL). To use this demo, first set the
(<B>Quantify | Calibrate | Use demo leukemia gels ND wedge calibration
preloads</B>) first. Then, use the (<B>Quantify | Calibrate | Optical
density by step wedge</B>) command. We will be adding discussion and
documentation on calibration in the reference manual and we plan to
add vignettes.


<P><LI><B>V.0.65 2-16-2004:</B> Fixed various minor bugs and
refactored code. Reset the scroller and trial spot position to the
upper left hand corner when load a new image. Previously it was using
the same coordinates at the previous image or illegal coordinates [Bug
reported by Enrico De Toni].

<P><LI><B>V.0.63 02-11-2004:</B> Added grayscale histogram for the
computing window region of interest using the (<B>Quantify | Region Of
Interest (ROI) | Show RPI grayscale histogram (C-H)</B>)
command. Changed error paradigm so that it is easier to see error
messages. Error messages are shown in red. If the Popup Report window
is not visible, it is forced to be visible to call attention to the
error message.  Reorganized the <A HREF="flkRefMan.html#viewMenu">View
menu</A> so it is more logical. Added (<B>Quantify | View measurements
| Use 'circle'# else '+'# for meas. list</B>) - if both <IMG
SRC="Icons/checkboxON.gif" ALT="Checkbox on"><B>View spot measurements</B> and the <IMG
enabled, this will show the actual circle masks (of different sizes if
you changed the sizes) around each measured spot. Otherwise, it shows
it as a '+' marker. Fixed various other minor bugs.

<P><LI><B>V.0.62 02-02-2004:</B> Added commands to print a 5x5 through
40x40 gray-scale window (in decimal, octal, or hex number radix) in
the popup report window. The (<B>Quantify menu | Print data-window |
Set print-window size</B>) lets you specify the window size. The
(<B>Quantify menu | Print data-window | Set print-data radix</B>) set
the data format radix.  The (<B>Quantify menu | Print data-window |
Show data-window of selected pixel (C-V)</B>). Normally, set the
print-window size and data radix then use the (C-V) short-cut key
after you have selected the spot you want to view. The following shows
typical output:

<P><LI><B>V.0.61 01-31-2004:</B> Fixed problem that if you started
Flicker from a previously saved .flk state file by double clicking on
it's icon, it did not completely restore the state.  However, if you
restored the state using (<B>File menu | Open state file</B>) it did
it correctly. This fixed the problem that measured spot lists were not
restored with the former, but were with the latter [reported by Enrico
De Toni]. Also fixed the graphics problem where spot positions of "+#"
markers in measured circles were correctly measured, but the position
was off a few pixels.

<P><LI><B>V.0.60 01-28-2003:</B> Fixed bug that if you saved a Flicker
state in a .flk file that pointed to some images that you subsequently
moved or deleted on your disk, Flicker would hang and you would need
to kill the process (e.g., Task manager in Windows). This has been
fixed by reporting the problem and then exiting flicker. It is up to
the user to either restore the image to the previous location, or to
not use the .flk file. [Reported by Enrico De Toni]. Also fixed bug in
(<B>Quantify menu | Measure by circle | List spots in the spot list
(tab-delimited</B>) where the table header was not aligned with the
data. [Reported by Enrico De Toni].

<P><LI><B>V.0.59, 01-24-2004:</B> Fixed bug where data could not be
added to the circle measurement list. The problem occurs if you
defined a set of circle measurements, then saved the Flicker state
(File | Save(As) State file), and then restored this state in a later
session. The original spots were there, but you could not add
additional spots. Note, you can currently measure up to 1000
spots. [Thanks to Enrico De Toni for reporting this bug.]

<P><LI><B>V.0.58, 01-19-2004:</B> Moved Flicker from the Open2Dgel
project to the new <http://open2dprot.sourceforge.net"
TARGET="_top">Open2Dprot</A>.

<P><LI><B>V.0.57, 01-13-2004:</B> Fixed bug when accessing
Swiss-2DPAGE database where it sometimes does not generate
the correct URL for clickable spots.

<P><LI><B>V.0.56, 01-07-2004:</B> Fixed bug in the image pipeline
processing where if you zoom first and then do an image transform, it
did not zoom the transform.

<P><LI><B>V.0.55, 12-27-2003:</B> Fixed bug in the image pipeline
processing where if you zoom first and then use the
brightness/contrast filter, it did not use the zoomed image. Now you
can use both zoom and brightness contrast and any other transform and
it will do a (iImg > oImg > zImg > bgImg) pipeline processing. Of
course, doing both zoom and brightness/contrast filtering will take
longer. Doing a Reset images will clear the zoom and BC filtering.

<P><LI><B>V.0.54, 12-22-2003:</B> Fixed the recent images database
that updates DB/FlkRecentDB.txt save and restore state. It limits the
history to the last 10 images. The (<B>File | Open recent images</B>)
lists the images. It records single images from the (<B>File | Open
file image</B>), (<B>File | Open URL image</B>). It also records pairs
of images from (<B>File | Open URL user images</B>) and when you load
a pair of images using the (<B>File | State | Open state file</B>).

<P><LI><B>V.0.53, 12-19-2003:</B> Added (<B>View | Gang zoom images</B>)
command to zoom the left and right images together. This is useful if
the images have exactly the same magnification.  Added an alternate
way of listing the measured spots list as (<B>Quantify | Measure by
circle | List spots in the spot list (tab-delimited)</B>). This lets
you cut and paste it or read the SaveAs text file from the popup
report window into Excel or other software. (Thanks to Stephen Lockett
for suggestions). Also fixed problem where it would jitter if you
tried to flicker the images after doing a (<B>File | Reset
images</B>).


<P><LI><B>V.0.52, 12-17-2003:</B> fixed drawing error with numbered
spots where is was off a few pixels when it drew "+1", "+2, "+3", etc.

<P><LI><B>V.0.51, 12-13-2003:</B> Moved the (<B>File | Update |
...</B>) server from the mirror (<A
HREF="http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/Flicker" TARGET="_top">
http://www.ccrnp.ncifcrf.gov/Flicker</A>) to the SourceForge server <A
HREF="http://open2dprot.sourceforge.net" TARGET="_top">
http://open2dprot.sourceforge.net</A>.

<P><LI><B>V.0.50, 12-12-2003:</B> Fixed bug where the
"Flicker.parameters" file was generated correctly using the (<B>File |
Quit</B>) command, but not it you close the window from the GUI. Also,
added a command (<B>Edit | Reset default view</B>) to set the view to
the initial value without reading your "Flicker.parameters" file. This
lets you overide your saved parameter default.

<P><LI><B>V.0.49, 12-12-2003:</B> Added additional user setable
parameters to the state that is saved with (<B>File | Save(As) state
file</B>). Also save a subset of these parameters that are generic
user preferences in a "Flicker.properties" when you Quit the
program. When you next start Flicker, it will attempt to read and use
these user preferences.  For example, you may want to use a red trial
object cursor instead of yellow, etc. Fixed bug so can now save and
restore correctly circular-mask measured spot lists you generated a
series of circular mask spot measurements and saved with the (<B>File
| State | Save(As)...</B>) command.

<P><LI><B>V.0.48, 12-11-2003:</B> Added (<B>File | SaveAs overlay
image</B>) menu command to save the selected image including overlays
as a GIF image you specify. If you are displaying the gray value as
you move the mouse (<B>View | Display gray values (C-G)</B> and the
size of the circle mask is > 1, then draw the circle mask as you move
the mouse so the user can see the area being measured. Added "tot" or
"mn" prefix to this displayed data values depending on whether the
(<B>Quantify | <IMG SRC="Icons/checkboxON.gif" ALT="Checkbox on"> Use sum density else
mean density</B>).  Added (<B>Quantify | Measure by circle | Delete
selected spot from the spot list</B>) so you can edit the
list. Changed the default trial object color from yellow to orange
which is a little easier to see. Changed the default circular mask
size from 5x5 to 11x11. Changed the default measurement circular mask
color from yellow to red.

<P><LI><B>V.0.46, 12-10-2003:</B> Move the user's image discovery
menus from (<B>File | Open demo images | ...</B>) to (<B>File | Open
user images | ...</B>) since they are not really part of the demo
images.  Added ability to save measured circular mask spots in a spot
list that is saved (when you do a (File | State | SaveAs ...) in the
"spt/" directory as a file with the same name as the image but with a
".spt" file extension. You can now sequentially label a series of
circular mask spot measurements and it labels them with "+1", "+2",
etc. You can also make a report of all spots. They will be saved when
you save the state and are restored when you restore the state.  You
can now adjust the trial object color through the (Edit | Set colors |
Trial object color).

<P><LI><B>V.0.45, 12-09-2003:</B> Added extension to demo images. If
the use had put one or more directories of the image data in the
Images/ folder. Then when Flicker starts, it will create additional
submenu entries in the (<B>File | Open demo images | ...</B>) that are the
names of the user's directories. Within each submenu, it will generate
all combinations of the image files within the corresponding directory
and denote them as for example, "image3 vs. image5", etc. The maximum
measurement circle size has been increased from 11x11 to 15x15. A new
measurement option, <B>(Quantify | <IMG SRC="Icons/checkboxON.gif" ALT="Checkbox on">Use
measurement counter)</B> has been added to let you track your
measurements in the report log more easily.

<P><LI><B>V.0.44, 12-01-2003:</B> Only has the zoom/dezoom method
transform. It is ONLY invoked from the ZoomMag scroller - not from
the Transform menu.

<P><LI><B>V.0.43, 11-28-2003:</B> New zoom/dezoom transform method
that covers 1/10X to 10X zoom. Fixed the Median filter. Added "Max
3x3" and "Min 3x3" filters. This version has both AWT zoom and
transform zoom.

<P><LI><B>V.0.42, 11-26-2003:</B> Added (<B>(File | Save Transformed
image</B>) and (<B>(Edit | Enable saving transformed images when do a
'Save(As) state'</B>) to save transformed images to a "tmp/" directory
as .gif files.

<P><LI><B>V.0.41, 11-24-2003:</B> Fixed bug introduced in version 0.37
when clicked on canvas, it failed under some conditions. Fixed the
SaveAs state so that it saves more of the state and also restore the
landmarks and position properly. Added log(grayscale) option to use
when reading grayscale images more than 8-bits (e.g., 10-bit, 12-bit
or 16-bit tiff grayscale images).

<P><LI><B>V.0.37, 11-17-2003:</B> Added Resize canvas menu and code to
resize the three windows up or down using either menu commands or the
"-"/"+" canvas resize buttons. The menu commands are (<B>Edit |
Canvas size | in(de)crease size</B>). Added (<B>Edit | Resize Flicker
memory limits</B>) to let the user change the initial startp memory
limits over the range of 30Mb to 1768 Mb.

<P><LI><B>V.0.36, 11-14-2003:</B> Fixed suble error in ROI rectangle
drawing routine. Added code to let you define the ROI as between the
C-U and C-L marks and it will flip their definitions if required.

<LI><B>Version 0.35, 11-14-2003:</B> fixed minor bugs, added (C-R) to
(Quantify | Region of interest (ROI) Capture measurement by ROI (C-R))
command

<LI><B>Version 0.35, 11-13-2003:</B> fixed ROI display and measurement,
misc. minor bugs.

<LI><B>Version 0.34, 11-12-2003:</B> fixed misc. minor bugs.

<LI><B>Version 0.33, 11-11-2003:</B> fixed misc. minor bugs.

<LI><B>Version 0.32, 11-10-2003:</B> Implemented the (File | Update |
Update Demo Images DB)

<LI><B>Version 0.31, 11-10-2003:</B> Refactored affine warping and
fixed various other commands including Quantify Measure by circles and
added Measure by ROI. Added C-T command and a few other commands.
Fixed thresholding automatic transforms when move sliders on the
selected image.  Avoid race condition if adjusting threshold and angle
sliders by ignoring command if already doing a transform. Other misc.
fixes.

<LI><B>Version 0.30, 11-07-2003:</B> Affine working.

<LI><B>Version 0.29, 11-03-2003:</B> Addressed misc. minor bugs

<LI><B>Version 0.28, 10-31-2003:</B> This is the initial alpha-level
release. It is functional however with a few problems which are in the
process of being addressed
